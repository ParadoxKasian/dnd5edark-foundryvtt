# D&D5E Dark Mode - Foundry VTT

- A dark sheet style for the default D&D5E Character,NPC and Item sheets and also for [BetterNPCSheets5e](https://github.com/syl3r86/BetterNPCSheet5e) by Felix.

Tested on Foundry v0.6

This module overwrites the styling (CSS) of the official 5e sheet that comes with dnd5e system for foundry and also BetterNPCSheets5e 
* All the same functionality, just different color scheme.

You can select the Dark sheet per Actor.
